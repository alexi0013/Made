# Project Plan

## Title
Forecasting extreme weather (wildfires and floods) in third-world countries like Greece.

## Main Question
1. Are there patterns for extreme weather in greece?
2. How precise can extreme weather events be forecasted?
3. How can Forecasting be implemented in order to help third world countries to be able to react faster?

## Description
This study aims to examine and forecast extreme weather events, specifically wildfires and floods, in third-world countries such as Greece. The focus will be on leveraging data analysis techniques to understand the patterns and drivers of these natural disasters. The analysis will utilize historical weather data, climate change indicators, and socio-economic factors to build predictive models. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help mitigate the impact of these extreme weather events.
